 Animals and Flowers.\nThere are 25 rounds in each mode, with a timer of 5 seconds for each
 round. Try to guess the animal or the flower in the picture before the timer runs out, and then click
 on the next button on the bottom right of the screen to go to the next round.
\nThere are five lives for each game.\nThe score for each game is calculated on the basis of your streak as well, so try to get
 as many correct as possible in a single run.\nGOOD LUCK!!" />
